# -Spatial-Query-Assistant-GeoAI-with-LangGraph-Earth-Engine
This project is a natural language-powered spatial analysis tool that enables users to ask complex geospatial questions like:

“Show me areas in Gujarat below 50 meters elevation”
“Give me a 1km buffer around Shimla”
“Which areas in Chennai are safe from flooding?”

It uses a LangGraph-based reasoning engine built on top of ChatGroq + LangChain and integrates with Earth Engine, raster/vector GIS tools, and OpenStreetMap data.
